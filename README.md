# Lossd
The current repository contains partial core code of the paper "Research on Improving Aerial Image Semantic Segmentation Based on Distance Loss", including the implementation of the core algorithm for distance loss-based semantic segmentation and verification code for key modules, which can be used for preliminary reference.
We will organize and upload the complete experimental code (including full logs of model training, data preprocessing procedures, configuration of comparative experiments, and detailed descriptions of all dependent environments, etc.) to this repository upon the acceptance of our paper by the journal, ensuring the reproducibility of the research results.

本仓库当前包含论文《基于距离损失提升航空图像语义分割的研究》的部分核心代码，涵盖了基于距离损失的语义分割核心算法实现及关键模块验证代码，可供初步参考。
我们将会在文章被期刊接收后，将完整的实验代码（包括模型训练全量日志、数据预处理流程、对比实验配置及所有依赖环境说明等）整理并上传至本仓库。
